# Chatbot
A plugin based, extendable chatbot written in Python.

## Requirements
The following python modules are required and can be installed using pip:

```shell
# pip install appdirs sortedcontainers
```

Additionally you will need the python bindings for the chat protocols you want to use.<br>

* **Tox:** pytoxcore ([this fork](https://github.com/mphe/pytoxcore))
  * **Most certainly broken with recent versions and no longer supported by this project**
* **Discord:** discord.py rewrite ([here](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite))


## Compatibility

* Requires Python 3.
* Only tested on Linux, but should theoretically work on other platforms, too.
